## Models Used

| Model              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression  | Baseline model. Interpretable and performs well with standardized features. |
| Random Forest      | Handles nonlinearities and interactions, provides feature importance.       |
| XGBoost            | Boosted tree model, robust and highly accurate for tabular data.            |
| ARIMA              | Time series forecasting model, good at capturing temporal patterns.         |
